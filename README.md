
## MERN Task Manager App

The MERN Task Manager App is a full-featured task management web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage their daily tasks with features like secure authentication, drag-and-drop functionality, and seamless user interaction. This app is designed to enhance productivity by enabling users to create, update, delete, and organize tasks effortlessly.

The application includes secure login functionality using email and password authentication via JWT (with HttpOnly cookies), as well as Google Sign-in through Firebase Authentication. Users can manage their tasks by creating, editing, viewing, and deleting them. Each task can be marked as completed, and users can also filter or search tasks based on their needs.

To make the user experience more intuitive, the app supports a smooth drag-and-drop feature to rearrange tasks. All data, including tasks and user accounts, are securely stored in a MongoDB database. The user interface is fully responsive, built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS (or your preferred styling framework), ensuring a clean and modern design across devices.
